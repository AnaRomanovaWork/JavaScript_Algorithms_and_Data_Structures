# JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures

This repository contains my solutions and projects from the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification course.

## [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game project](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/rock_paper_scissors_game)

A simple interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors web game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Players can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, compete against a computer with random choices, and see the scores update in real-time. 
The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches 3 points, and includes a reset button to start a new game.

**Features:**

- Dynamic score tracking for player and computer
- Randomized computer moves
- Win, lose, and tie messages displayed after each round
- Reset functionality to restart the game

## [Calorie counter project](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/calorie_counter)

A web app where users enter their daily calorie goal and the calories they’ve eaten for each meal. 
The program totals the calories, compares them to the goal, and displays whether the user is in a surplus or deficit.

**What I Learned**
- Connecting HTML form inputs to JavaScript to collect and process user data
- Converting input values from strings to numbers for calculations
- Using arithmetic operations and the ternary operator for conditional output
- Dynamically updating the DOM to display results
- Controlling element visibility with the classList property
- Structuring a simple user input → logic → output flow in a web app

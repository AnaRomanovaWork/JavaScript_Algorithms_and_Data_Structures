# JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures

This repository contains my solutions and projects from the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification course.

## [Date formatter project](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/date_formatter)
This project focuses on working with dates in JavaScript.

**What I learned:**
-How to create and manipulate Date objects
-How to extract and set specific parts of a date
-How to calculate time differences
-The difference between input and change events
-How to use switch statements for multiple conditions
-How to split strings into arrays and reverse arrays or strings


## [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game project](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/rock_paper_scissors_game)

A simple interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors web game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Players can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, compete against a computer with random choices, and see the scores update in real-time. 
The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches 3 points, and includes a reset button to start a new game.

**Features:**

- Dynamic score tracking for player and computer
- Randomized computer moves
- Win, lose, and tie messages displayed after each round
- Reset functionality to restart the game

## [Calorie counter project](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/calorie_counter)

A web app where users enter their daily calorie goal and the calories they’ve eaten for each meal. 
The program totals the calories, compares them to the goal, and displays whether the user is in a surplus or deficit.

**What I Learned**
- Connecting HTML form inputs to JavaScript to collect and process user data
- Converting input values from strings to numbers for calculations
- Using arithmetic operations and the ternary operator for conditional output
- Dynamically updating the DOM to display results
- Controlling element visibility with the classList property
- Structuring a simple user input → logic → output flow in a web app

## [Music player](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/music_player)

A web app where user can listen music from the list of tracks.

**What I Learned**
- Web Audio API – working with audio in the browser
- JavaScript features: Spread operator (...), Arrow functions (=>), Optional chaining (?.)
- Array methods: map(), forEach(), filter(), find(), sort(), indexOf(), join()
- Callbacks – passing functions as arguments
- DOM manipulation: textContent, innerText vs createTextNode(), createElement(), appendChild(), setAttribute()

## [Palindrome checker](https://github.com/AnaRomanovaWork/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/tree/master/palindrome_checker)

A simple web application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that checks whether an input value is a palindrome. 
It ignores punctuation, spaces, and capitalization to accurately detect palindromes.

This project was completed as the final assignment for the first part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.
